Ruby Class Variables
In Ruby, class variables are attached to the class in which they are declared. A class variable should be declared with two @ symbols preceding it.

Ruby .new Method
In Ruby, a new class instance can be created by calling the .new method of the class. Arguments to the class’ initialize method can be passed in to the .new call.

Ruby Instance Variable
In Ruby, the @ symbol is used to signify an instance variable. Instance variables hold a value specific to each instance of that class, not to all members of the class itself.

Ruby initialize Method
In a Ruby class, an initialize method is used to generate new instances of the class. It is usually the first method of a class.

Ruby Class
A Ruby class is used to organize and model objects with similar attributes and methods.

Ruby super Keyword
Ruby’s built-in super keyword is used to directly access the attributes or methods of a superclass. This means a class with super will inherit the attributes or methods of a superclass.

Ruby attr_reader attr_writer Methods
In Ruby, attr_reader and attr_writer are methods used to read and write variables, respectively.

Ruby namespace
In Ruby, the term namespace refers to a module the contains a group of related objects. An example of a Ruby namespace is the Math module.

Ruby require Keyword
In Ruby, the require keyword is used to fetch a certain module which isn’t yet presented in the interpreter. It is best practice to place this at the beginning of your code.

Ruby Module
In Ruby, a module contains a set of methods, constants, or classes which can be accessed with the . operator similarly to classes . Unlike classes, it is impossible to create instances of a Ruby module.

Ruby attr_accessor Method
In Ruby, attr_accessor, used to make a variable both readable and writeable, is a shortcut to attr_reader and attr_writer.
